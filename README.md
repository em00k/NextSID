 Here you will find two players containing an engine for playing back PT3 files that allows you to apply custom duty cycles on the AY channels to produce a SID like sounds.

 This is a general player that allows you to load PT3 files from SD. You can then set the parameters and save an "NT3" file, this holds the custom params for that particluar song. When you load a PT3 file if an NT3 exists the parameters are automatically loaded.
